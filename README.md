# React + Redux w/ ES6 

这是利用react+redux 做的一个购物单例子

The provided boilerplate enables client-side ES6 via the following technologies:

- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) as a client-side module builder and module loader.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager and task runner (say [**NO**](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/) to gulp/grunt).
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) 6 as a transpiler from ES6 to ES5.
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) as a virtual Dom JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (views).
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as an incredibly simple way of modelling your data app state, with great community support.
- [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) as a live-editing environment for your Redux apps.
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) as a reporter for syntax and style issues. [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) for additional React specific linting rules.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a compiler of CSS styles with variables, mixins, and more.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as a test framework.
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as a BDD assertion library that works along with `Mocha`.
